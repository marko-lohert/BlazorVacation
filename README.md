# BlazorVacation
A demo application I have used in a number of talks (conference, meetups).

This demo is a Blazor WebAssembly application, that runs using WebAssembly on the client-side, and an ASP.NET Core application on the server side. This demo app runs on .NET Core 3.1.


## Blazor features in this demo application
This demo application contains the following Blazor features:
-	Components
-	Data binding
-   Forms and validation
-	Routing
-	Dependency injection
-	Layouts (including nested layouts)
-	JavaScript interop

-   Presentation and logic are separated using partial classes


## Database setup
